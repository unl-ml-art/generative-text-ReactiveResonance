# Project 1 Generative Text

Caleb Kirilov, ckirilov2@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

Speech can be a weapon or a tool of silver tongues. Some cause catastrophe, and some spark great awakenings.

I would like to combine some of the most famous speeches or excerpts from a wide range of morality with the goal of creating the most impactful speech without a human author.


It this is too cliche, I have an even more cliche idea to auto generate quotes from these speeches in the same vein as InspiroBot

## Model/Data

The generative text with require several famous speeches from various authors.
- A few names that come up at first are Ghandi, MLK Jr., Timothy Mcvay, Abraham Lincoln, Jesus, FDR, Carl Sagan (speaking to congress)
- An AI best for long term information digestion is prefered 
- The model should be able to interpret scripts of speeches into repeatable patterns with interchangable variables. These variables change the minor aspects while retaining the core speech style throughout. 

## Code (WIP)

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results (WIP)

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes (WIP)

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference (WIP)

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
  - [This is a paper](this_is_the_link.pdf)
- Repositories
- Blog posts
